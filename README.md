## About
Highfy provides a convenient solution for ordering drinks and snacks for delivery around the clock. The application is developed using React Native, a popular framework for building cross-platform mobile applications, and TypeScript, a superset of JavaScript that enhances code quality.

## Important note
This is an unfinished project. The other screens have to be implemented, at the moment there is only the search screen, and it has to be connected to the API which is private at the moment. Some screens are already designed in Figma, and others are under development. The Figma project is [here](https://www.figma.com/file/mAeSD0g2AWuu9HFtV2AHAE/highfy-app).
